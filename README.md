PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version

packages that are distributed separately from Perl.  We recommend that
you have the following packages installed before you install

LWP::UserAgent

DOCUMENTATION

See the lib/LWP/Simple/REST.pm file for an overview of the library. See the
Changes file for recent changes.

POD style documentation is included in all modules and scripts.  These
are normally converted to manual pages and installed as part of the
"make install" process.  You should also be able to use the 'perldoc'
utility to extract and read documentation from the module files
directly.
